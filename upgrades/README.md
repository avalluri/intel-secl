NOTE:
iHUB and WPM does not support direct upgrade from v3.5.0 to v4.0.0. As,
1. iHUB service has been changed from single instance to multi-instance support in v3.6.0.
2. WPM has changed its directory structure

For these two components, user need to upgrade to v3.6.0 first then to the latest version v4.0.0
